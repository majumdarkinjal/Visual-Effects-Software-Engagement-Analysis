Understanding the Data - fields that will be used in analysis

Because the unit of the duration field is not known, I will use timestamp information for any time based calculations (taking the difference between the maximum and minimum timestamp of each session and calculating the difference to determine Session duration)

The data is stored in a json format. 

In order for us to use the data and comprehend it we will need to unnest it. 

This table captures events pertaining to user behavior in Session. Aka what tools they use, entry point, exit point, and parameters pertaining to each event.

Id - unique user identifier. A unique id is assigned to each user.

Sessionid- unique identifier for each Session registered.

Timestamp - logs the timestamp associated to the event 

Parameters: 

Bakebackend - bakebackend usage info including version

SourceView - the GUI used to access the particular tool. Info in here indicates what type of tool was used, including lighting tools.

Lightmapsize - the size of the lightmap used
